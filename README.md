Assassination rogue 1-button rotation for T-Wow. Run it via /RogueRotation
It uses Noxious Assault for combo point generation, keeps Envenom (2 or 3 combo points) and Slice and Dice (1 or 2 combo points) up. Envenom is prioritized.
If you have more than 3 combo points, it waits to cast an Eviscerate before buffing Envenom and Slice and Dice again.
